___
# Tools
#### I built this website with the following:
* React.js / JSX
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Atom
* Adobe Illustrator
* npm packages
 * create-react-app
 * react-router-dom
 * react-responsive-carousel

# Reflection

## Motive

This was a project built to replace an outdated restaurant website for a local business that was not currently maintained.

I took this project as an opportunity to familiarize myself with React.js and contemporary web development practices. I started this project using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. Then, routing is implemented using components from `react-router-dom`.

## Future Addition Plans
In the next iteration of this website I plan to utilize more web technologies to create a better user design and experience.

* Gatsbyjs for better SEO with isomorphic routing
* Google Maps API
* Online order integration into main website
