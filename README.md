## Reflection

### Motive

This was a project built to replace an outdated restaurant website for a local business that was not currently maintained. 

I took this project as an opportunity to familiarize myself with React.js and contemporary web development practices. I started this project using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. Then, routing is implemented using components from `react-router-dom`. 

Overall, all of the technologies used in this project were:
Reactjs, JSX, HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

### Future Addition Plans

* Isomorphic React Routing
* Google Maps API
